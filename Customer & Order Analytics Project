#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--1.How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT C.acctnum
FROM customers C
JOIN FebSales F
ON C.order_id = F.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT product, min(price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product
HAVING length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT
sum(Quantity), location,
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct C.acctnum),avg(F.price * F.Quantity)
FROM FebSales F
LEFT JOIN customers C
ON F.orderID = C.order_id
WHERE F.Quantity >2 AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--8. find the total quantity of product sold in february 18th.

SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%';

--9. find the total quantity of product sold from 02/13/19 to 02/18/19.

SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00';

--10.. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%Headphones%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product

--11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--12.Find order ids from Georgia (GA) where the order has an average price greater than $1,000. 
--Only find orders from dates beginning with ‘04/1’. Assume that the dates are stored in the MM/DD/YY HH:MM format.
--select * from AprSales

SELECT orderID
FROM BIT_DB.AprSales
WHERE orderdate LIKE '04/1%'
AND location LIKE '%GA%'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY orderID
HAVING AVG(price) > 1000;

--13. You’ve been given the following results from the MaySales table. Can you reverse engineer a SQL query that returns these results?
--The result set will naturally only return 10 rows (i.e., you will not have to use LIMIT to get to 10 results).

SELECT location, orderID
FROM MaySales
WHERE orderID LIKE '%1943_5'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
ORDER BY orderID;

--14.Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
--In other words, show the one product that generated the most revenue (revenue being equivalent to quantity of an item multiplied by the item’s price).

SELECT Product , SUM(Quantity *Price) AS Max_rev
FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product
HAVING SUM(Quantity *Price)
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity *Price) DESC
LIMIT 1;
