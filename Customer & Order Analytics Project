#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--1.How many many unique orders were placed in January? In other words, how many distinct order ids do we have?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT C.acctnum
FROM customers C
JOIN FebSales F
ON C.order_id = F.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, min(price)
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product
HAVING length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--5.What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
,product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
sum(Quantity), location,
product,
sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct C.acctnum),avg(F.price * F.Quantity)
FROM FebSales F
LEFT JOIN customers C
ON F.orderID = C.order_id
WHERE F.Quantity >2 AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--8. find the total quantity of product sold in february 18th.
SELECT sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate like '02/18/19%';

--9. find the total quantity of product sold from 02/13/19 to 02/18/19.
SELECT orderdate
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE orderdate between '02/13/19 00:00' AND '02/18/19 00:00';
