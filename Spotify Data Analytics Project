# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

--1. Find top 10 songs by populartity

SELECT track_name AS song,artist_name, popularity
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

--2.Top artists by average popularity 

SELECT artist_name, ROUND(avg(popularity), 2) AS avg_popularity, count(*) AS track_number
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(*)>1
ORDER BY ROUND(avg(popularity), 2) DESC
LIMIT 10;

--3.Are danceable songs more popular?

SELECT 
    CASE WHEN danceability > 0.8 
    THEN 'danceable'
    ELSE 'Non_danceable' 
    END AS category
    ,ROUND(AVG(popularity),2) AS popularity
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY category;

INSIGHT: 
There is no significant difference in popularity between danceable and non-danceable songs. 
Non-danceable songs have a slightly higher average popularity (86.86 vs 86), indicating that danceability alone does not strongly influence popularity.

--4.Mood vs popularity (valence)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(popularity), 2) AS avg_popularity,
    CASE 
    WHEN valence >= 0.6 
    THEN 'Happy'
    ELSE 'Sad/Neutral'
    END AS mood
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY mood;

--5.Which artists have released the most songs in this dataset?

SELECT artist_name, count(track_name) AS track_count
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING track_count>2
ORDER BY track_count DESC;

--6.What is the average duration of popular songs and non-popular songs
--Compare average duration of popular vs non-popular songs

SELECT 
    CASE
    WHEN popularity >'86' 
    THEN 'Popular'
    ELSE 'Non-popular' 
    END AS Category 
    ,ROUND(AVG(duration_ms)/60000, 2) AS avg_duration_min
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY Category;

--7.What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(danceability), 2) AS avg_danceability
FROM (
    SELECT danceability
    FROM spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 10
) AS top10;
